# Capstone
My capstone project for CSUCI Spring 2025.

## Dev-Notes
**10/09/2024** - I have not looked into this project for some time.\
I have unfortunately forgotten where I left off and will now journal what my progress.\
Dr. Feister has advised me that the scope for having a rescue worker tool is too high and that I need to either limit it or truly reach out to rescue workers and see if it is remotely useful.
> From now on, I will dedicate myself to the "fire alarm" w/ "mesh warning tiers" collected in a "heatmap timeline"

I will need to look into whether or not the pi zeroes are GPS module ready or not.\
I do not remember if I ever implemented the module into one.\
I believe I only used dummy data...time to try the real thing out, get GPS logged, then send a real GPS point to the other pi.
